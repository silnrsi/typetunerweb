Lateef font
=================

This file provides detailed information on the Lateef font software. 
This information should be distributed along with the Lateef fonts 
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information
----------------------

Lateef is named after Shah Abdul Lateef Bhitai, the famous Sindhi 
mystic and poet. It is intended to be an appropriate style for use 
in Sindhi and other languages of the South Asian region.

This font provides a simplified rendering of Arabic script, using basic 
connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional ligatures 
or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef ligatures). This 
simplified style is often preferred for clarity, especially in non-Arabic 
languages, but may be considered unattractive in more traditional and 
literate communities.

One font from this typeface family is included in this release:

     * Lateef Regular

This release supports virtually all of the Unicode 5.0 Arabic character 
repertoire (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks, which are not 
recommended for normal use). Font smarts are implemented using OpenType 
technology.

A Note Regarding the Open Font License and TypeTuner
----------------------------------------------------

The OFL prohibits the use of Reserved Font Names "Lateef" and "SIL" in
the name of any font that is derived from the Original Version of 
Lateef. However, SIL International (the Copyright Holder) grants through
this separate written agreement the right to use the Reserved Font Names
in any Modified Version of this font created by using TypeTuner as long
as the feature information contained in the Original Version is used, 
unmodified, as the source for TypeTuner feature information, and 
"Lateef" is not the resulting font family name.

TypeTuner-produced fonts created in this manner are still bound by the
terms of the OFL. Specifically, the use of Reserved Font Names is
prohibited when making derivatives of a TypeTuner-produced font. Anyone
making a derivative of a TypeTuner font will need to find a different
name. For example a TypeTuner-produced font may be named 
"Lateef SomeFarAwayPlace" but a derivative of that font made 
with other tools would not be allowed to use the "Lateef" or "SIL"
