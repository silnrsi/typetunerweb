Some facts that developers might like to know:

1. TYPETUNER INTERFACE

Presently this CGI script invokes TypeTuner in two ways:

    perl TypeTuner.pl -x output.xml input.ttf
    perl TypeTuner.pl [-n suffix] -o output.ttf applyset input.xml input.ttf

If the command line parameters to TypeTuner.pl change, this CGI scipt 
may need updating.


2. LINE ENDINGS MATTER

On xserve3 (scripts.sil.org), apparently the line-endings do matter for CGI
scripts. I've discovered that CRLF line endings don't work. Therefore I've
set the svn:eol-style property to LF making it possible to edit the file
on Windows and then scp it over to the appropriate folder on xserve.


3. URLs

The URL to access this tool on scripts.sil.org in interactive mode is:

    http://scripts.sil.org/ttw/fonts2go.cgi

As of 2011-08, the tool also supports "direct download" URLs whereby
specific packages defined on the server (see .packages below) can be
identified by a specially crafted URL. The URL options include:
    family  required: Specifies the font family tag (without spaces
            and without any version information)
    pkg     required: Specifies the TypeTuner configuration file to
            use (with spaces removed).
    ver     optional: The specific version desired.

So, for example, to retrieve the current SIL Charis Literacy Compact font,
the URL would be:

    http://scripts.sil.org/ttw/fonts2go.cgi?family=CharisSIL&pkg=LiteracyCompact

and to retrieve an older version, say 4.106:

    http://scripts.sil.org/ttw/fonts2go.cgi?family=CharisSIL&pkg=LiteracyCompact&ver=4.106

4. INSTALLATION 

Dependencies and location on a Debian container hosted in proxmox.

To install ttw on Debian:

sudo apt-get install libxml-parser-perl libfont-ttf-perl zip 
sudo mkdir /var/log/ttw 
sudo chown -R root:adm  /var/log/ttw

apache needs to know the handler:
add the following to a .htaccess in that folder:

Options +ExecCGI
AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

(this is checked to work with apache2-mpm-worker)


The relevant folders on are:

/var/www/scripts.sil.org/cms/ttw 
  -- root folder where the fonts2go.cgi should be located

/var/www/scripts.sil.org/cms/ttw/TypeTuner 
  -- subfolder  containing TypeTuner.pl

/var/www/scripts.sil.org/cms/ttw/TypeTuner/tunable-fonts
  -- subfolder containg source font packages. 

/var/www/scripts.sil.org/cms/ttw/TypeTuner/tunable-fonts/Andika
/var/www/scripts.sil.org/cms/ttw/TypeTuner/tunable-fonts/Charis SIL 
/var/www/scripts.sil.org/cms/ttw/TypeTuner/tunable-fonts/Doulos SIL 
etc...
  -- subfolders containing source font packages. As of 2009-10-21 the names of 
     these subfolders may have spaces.
      -- In addition to the source font package, these folders may contain:
           -- a configuration file named ".ttwrc" (see below)
           -- a file named ".hide". If this file is present, the font family
              is hidden from interactive mode users.
           -- a file named ".test". If present, the font family will be hidden
              from interactive users unless the "dev" parameter is on the URL
              or the CGI program name is something other than "fonts2go.cgi".
           -- a folder named ".packages" see below)
           -- a file named named ".help_url". The first line of this file should 
              be the URL of a page or document that provides user help regarding 
              the features supported by the fonts in the package. [use of this 
              file is deprecated]
      -- Any file whose name ends in _TT (optionally followed by an extension, e.g.
         FONTLOG_TT.txt) is processed by a script that replaces %DATE% and
         %ISODATE% with the current date (Dallas timezone). The first of these
         will be in "dd MMM yyyy" format, the second in "yyyy-mm-dd" format. The
         resultant file will not include the "_TT" in its name.
      -- As of 2010-11-24, arbitrary subfolder structures are allowed. The 
         above-mentioned text modification of files whose name ends in _TT 
         occurs in all subfolders.
      -- As of 2011-08-15, folder names may include a trailing version
         number such as " 4.106". Multiple versions of a single family can
         thus be available to TTW. However, in interactive mode TTW will 
         present only one version (normally the latest, but see ".hide" 
         file, above). Other versions are available only on the 
         direct-download URLs.

/var/www/scripts.sil.org/cms/ttw/TypeTuner/tunable-fonts/Family Name/.packages
  -- subfolder containing TypeTuner control files for preconfigured packages,
     thus making it possible to easily specify a URL that is a direct download
     of the specific configuration. For example, a file by the name:
        .https://scripts.sil.org/cms/TypeTuner/tunable-fonts/Charis SIL/.packages/Literacy Compact
     might contain the Typetuner control information for selecting the Literacy
     alternates and Tight line spacing, and thus the following URL would be a
     direct download link for that package:
       http://scripts.sil.org/ttw/fonts2go.cgi?family=CharisSIL&pkg=LiteracyCompact
     (Note the removal of the spaces in the parameter values.)

/var/log/ttw
  -- location of TTW log files. There is one line of output for each successful use
     of TTW, and the lines identify who is using the service along with what fonts
     and features were requested, and could be used to generate some statistics. 
     Example lines:

        2010-10-12 15:23:19 scripts.sil.org to 75.151.118.139: AndikaBasic Digit Zero with slash; Capital Q alternate; Line spacing = Tight;
        2010-10-25 11:17:32 scripts.sil.org to 65.93.97.180: Scheherazade Language = Urdu; Shadda+kasra placement = Raised; Sukun = Open down; Dotless head of khah = Jasm open left; Downward comma; Six-nine dammatan; End of ayah = Simplified A; Old Shina hack = Unicode 4.0;
        2010-11-03 07:02:47 scripts.sil.org to 203.153.30.194: AndikaBasic Literacy alternates = False; Digit One without base; Digit Four with open top; Digit Six and Nine alternates; Line spacing = Tight;
        2010-11-03 07:30:26 scripts.sil.org to 196.43.68.137: CharisSIL Literacy alternates;
     
/tmp
  -- folder containing temporary directory (named ttw*), and temporary debug 
     output file (named ttw*.txt). These are deleted upon successful completion 
     of the script; but if the script crashes they will remain and may
     be helpful in figuring out what went wrong.

5. .ttwrc FILE

As mentioned above, each font family folder may include a .ttwrc file which provides
optional information to fonts2go.cgi. Lines in this file are of the form:

    keyword = value

where whitespace is allowed before and after the keyword and the value, and also within the value.
Currently three keywords are recognized:

    helpurl - value is the URL of a page or document that provides user help 
            regarding the features supported by the fonts in the package.
    
    omittedfeature - value is the name of a feature that should be completely 
            omitted from TTW's UI
    
    omittedvalue - value is compound string which identifies a feature value 
            that should be omitted from TTW's UI. The format of this compound
            string is:  feature name : feature value

Example:

    helpurl = http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=CharisSIL_Technical#TTW_Help
    omittedfeature = Small Caps
    omittedvalue = Line spacing : Imported 
    

6. DEBUGGING

Debugging CGI scripts can be a pain. To aid in that process, fonts2go.cgi sends
progress messages to a temporary file in the /tmp folder. The file will have a name
matching the pattern "ttw*.txt".  This file is normally deleted upon successful
completion of the script, but if the script crashes (or you comment out the 
appropriate unlink command), then you may get useful info out of this file.
The subroutine appendtemp() can be called to add detail to this temporary file.
